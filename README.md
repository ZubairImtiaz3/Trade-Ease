## The Process <a name="the orocess"></a>

I began by setting up the backend with Supabase. I designed a database schema featuring three key tables: `invoices` for all invoice data, `invoice_items` for individual items, and `profiles` for user company details.

For the frontend, I chose Next.js and Shadcn UI. Next.js helped me lay the foundation, while Shadcn UI allowed me to craft a sleek and functional user interface.

User authentication was powered by Supabase‚Äôs built-in features, ensuring a secure and seamless experience. I also created an onboarding screen to collect and store user company data in the `profiles` table.

Managing invoices was next. I integrated the Supabase API to both create and display invoices. To handle PDF generation, I used a library to create and format invoices based on a template.

Lastly, I built a dynamic sales dashboard to show analytics. By fetching data from Supabase,  I was able to populate the dashboard and display key metrics, providing users with valuable sales analytics.

Along the way, while building everything, I took notes on what I've learned so I don't miss out on it. I also documented the behind-the-scenes processes every time a feature was added.

It's funny how writing down what I've built made me understand it better. When I started documenting the features and processes, I realized that stepping back and reflecting on it really helps me get a clearer picture. It's a great habit to develop when learning something new.

## How it can be improved

<li>
<b>Public Sign-Ups: </b> Our current architecture can handle multiple user data concurrently, so the next step is to enable public sign-ups, allowing a broader user base to access and utilize the app.
</li>
<li>
   <b>Custom Product Management: </b>
Allow users to add their own products and customize product attributes, such as size, to better fit their specific needs.
</li>
<li>
<b>Additional PDF Templates: </b>
 Expand the range of available PDF invoice templates to offer more options for users, enabling them to choose or design templates that best suit their branding and presentation needs.
</li>
